### Chapter 3

This chapter talks about lists, starting with oredered lists which consist of list items that are ordered with numbers or letters, and unordered lists which consist of list items that are marked by bullet points and are not ordered.
Another type is definition lists which contains terms and their definitions, and nested lists which are lists inside lists.

### Chapter 13

A box is what surrounds contents of the same kind, you can control the box's dimension using width and height tags, and you can also limit the dimensions of these boxes with min and max-width and height tags.
Every box has a border which seperates it's edges from other boxes, and has a margin which extends beyond the border and a padding between the contents of the box and its border.
We can control the border's width, style and color. While you can only control the size of margins and padding.
Elements can be inline, block, or inline-block or just none which is hidden.
We can add an image as the border of a box or add shadows or rounded corners or even elliptical shapes.

# Duckett JS Book

### Chapter 2
This is just a review about arrays from yesterday's reading.

### Chapter 4 
This a continuation to the chapter staring from the switch. 
A switch statement contains a variable called switch value and cases each containing a possible value for the switch value and a code to run corresponding to that value. And a default case to run a code if none of the cases happened.
Data types can be coerced from one type to another in JS to try to do an operation.
All values are either truthy or falsy.
There are 3 types of loops, for, while, do..while and each repeat a set of statements until a condition is true.
