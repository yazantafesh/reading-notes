The webpage can be represented using a DOM tree.
There are 4 types of nodes is DOM trees; document, element, attribute and text.
Element nodes can be selected using their id or class attributes or tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
When multiple nodes are to be returned, a NodeList is returned.
We can access an element node's content and update them using properties like textContent and innerHTML or DOM manipulation techniques.
Element nodes can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
jQuery is popular because the implementation of the DOM is inconsistent in older browsers.
