# Duckett HTML Book

### Chapter 7

This chapter talks about forms which are used whenever we want to collect information from users, and the information from a form is sent as name-value pairs.
Form controls are given names and the text the user types in or the the values of the options they choose are sent to the server.
In HTML5 there are new form elements which make life a lot easier for users and eases the process of filling data in.

### Chapter 14

This chapter introduces CSS properties other than the ones covered in previous chapters that work with all elements, these are specifically used to modify the appearances of tables, lists and forms.
We can change the appearance of list markers with list-style-type and list-style image properties.
Usually table cells have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but some properties can be used to control them and make them more consistent.
Interactive styles benefit forms.

# Duckett JS Book

### Chapter 6

This chapter talks about events, events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened such as page loading or a button being clicked.
Binding is the process of stating which event you are
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting
for that event to happen upon.
When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a
JavaScript function. When this function then changes
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because
it has responded to the user.
You can use event delegation to monitor for events
that happen on all of the children of an element.
The most commonly used events are W3C DOM
events, although there are others in the HTMLS
specification as well as browser-specific events.
