# Duckett JS Book

### Chapter 10

This chapter talks about debugging and error handling in JavaScript, first it says that if we understand execution contexts that have two stages, we are more likely to find the error in the code.
Debugging is another meaning for finding errors in the code, it involves the process of deduction.
The browser console is very helpful tool for debugging, as it narrows down the area in which the error is located, so we can try to find the exact error.
JS has 7 different types of errors, each one creates its own error object which can tell you its line number and give a short description about it.
If we know that we may get an error, we can handle
it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements.
Use them to give your users helpful feedback.
