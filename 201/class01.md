### Chapter 18
This chapter starts with helping me understand the targeted audience for my website and what questions to ask myself and the client when trying to figure out the audience. Then it encourages me to study and research the specific goals and motivations of that audience and what they want to acheive when visiting my website. After that, I should be deciding what kind of information would be beneficial for them and how often will they be visiting the website.
An important step after that is the plan or the site map of the website which will help with the final design and the sorting of information in addition to a wireframe which will help with the graphic part of the design.
This chapter also emphasises on the idea that my site design is a reflection of what my message is supposed to be, the order, organization and priority of my content is extremely important for the succes of the website. Even the color, size and style of text or even images are all a vital part of the project. Also grouping, similarity and consistency can always help simplify the information I am presenting.


# Duckett JS Book

### Introduction
This chapter starts with an introduction about JS describing briefly what we can do with it like access or modify content, put some program rules or react to specific events, then it shows some examples of how it is used in different websites.

### Chapter 1
Then it talks about scripts and explains the idea behind a script and what it does then shows how to write one (state the goal then list tasks needed to achieve that goal then code each step or task).

- A **script** is a series of instructions that the computer can follow to achieve a set goal. And each time the script runs it does not have to use all of the intructions, it might only use a subset according to the situation in hand.

- Breaking down the script into tasks and drawing a flowchart can help a lot with the process of writing a script.
