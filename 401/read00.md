## How to Solve Programming Problems

    A simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.

        - Read the problem completely twice

        This is the single most important step. You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times and You want to make sure you completely understand the problem, A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.

        - Solve the problem manually

        Programming is automation plain and simple. You may have the ability to skip the manual steps and jump directly to code, but there is a manual process which is the foundation of any code you write.

        - Optimize the manual solution

        People often don’t realize how valuable this step is. It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code.

        - Write pseudo-code or comments

        Many times you can skip this step if you have a really good handle on the problem or your previous steps already created a detailed enough description of the solution that coding it is already a 1 to 1 translation.

        - Replace comments with real code

        This step should be extremely easy at this point. If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all.

## Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

    You have very few hours here on this earth. Still, many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach their true goals — their mission. The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth. They say yes to things they have no business doing. They give away their talents, attention, and effort to others who take, take, take. They spend hours watching low-quality television and social media when they should be productive and effective. See, many people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well)…but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy.

## How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving

Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding) :

- Try a solution.

- If that doesn’t work, try another one.

- If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

## 5 Whys

**How to Use the 5 Whys**

1- Assemble a Team

Include someone to act as a facilitator, who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

2- Define the Problem

observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.

3- Ask the First “Why?”

Ask your team why the problem is occurring.Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.

4- Ask “Why?” Four More Times

For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further “whys” in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you’ve just recorded.

5- Know When to Stop

if you’re not sure that you’ve uncovered the real root cause, consider using a more in-depth problem-solving technique like Cause and Effect Analysis, Root Cause Analysis, or FMEA.)

6- Address the Root Cause/s

discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.

7- Monitor Your Measures

Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem.

## What the heck is the event loop anyway?

JavaScript programmers like to use words like, “event-loop”, “non-blocking”, “callback”, “asynchronous”, “single-threaded” and “concurrency”.

We say things like “don’t block the event loop”, “make sure your code runs at 60 frames-per-second”, “well of course, it won’t work, that function is an asynchronous callback!”

If you’re anything like me, you nod and agree, as if it’s all obvious, even though you don’t actually know what the words mean; and yet, finding good explanations of how JavaScript actually works isn’t all that easy, so let’s learn!

With some handy visualisations, and fun hacks, let’s get an intuitive understanding of what happens when JavaScript runs.

## The Super Mario Effect

When 50,000 of Mark Rober's 3 million YouTube subscribers participated in a basic coding challenge, the data all pointed to what Rober has dubbed the Super Mario Effect. The YouTube star and former NASA engineer describes how this data-backed mindset for life gamification has stuck with him along his journey, and how it impacts the ways he helps (or tricks) his viewers into learning science, engineering, and design. Mark Rober has made a career out of engineering, entertainment, and education. After completing degrees in mechanical engineering from Brigham Young University and the University of Southern California, Rober joined NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2004. In his nine years as a NASA engineer, seven of which were on the Mars rover Curiosity team, Rober worked on both the Descent Stage (the jet pack that lowered the Rover to the surface) and some hardware on the Rover top deck for collecting samples. In 2011, Rober’s iPad-based Halloween costume helped launch both his creative costume company, Digital Dudz, and his YouTube channel, which now boasts 3 million subscribers and 400 million views.
