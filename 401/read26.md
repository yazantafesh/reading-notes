# Component Based UI

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React).

  - Ext JS by Sencha.
  - Angular.
  - Vue.
  - Ember.
  - Svelte 3.

- What’s the difference between a framework and a library?

  The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the application flow. You choose when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides you with a few places to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed. Framework is often more restrictive and generally have a more set of rules.Whereas, Library is not bounded by many rules.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- **Rendering** refers to showing the output in the browser.

- **Templates** refers to showing the output in the browser.

- **State** is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.

## Preparation Materials

### JSX

- JSX produces React “elements”.

- React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

- React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both.

- React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code.

- It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

- You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX.

## Component-based UI

empowers website development teams or UX consulting services providers with more efficiency, consistent GUI, and ease of maintaining any website. It can be of great use when you are playing with large web applications where plenty of UI elements are supposed to be maintained at a time‏

## ReactJS

is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
