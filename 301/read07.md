# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

    This article has a story of how **Google** found the knowledge from its path to build the perfect team for the job.  

    It starts with the story of a person named *Rozovsky* and her experience in teamwork with two different teams or groups in college and how she had two extremely different experiences with each of the groups.  

    Then it shows how important *team-work* is for the productivity these days and how big companies consider it a huge deal and spend huge amounts of money to get the best results in this field.  

    **Google** then started a research on how to build the perfect team to get the optimum productivity and get the best results.  

    *Rozovsky* and her team spent years on research to find the best combination or reason to achieve what they want.  

    In the end, they found out that the best practice is just opening up to each other and creating an open and friendly environment is the key to chemistry between team members and what will lead to much higher productivity and even fun time for the employees.

# How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

        He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

        Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

        HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

        Web pages usually have images, right? Those are separate resources. The web page just specifies the URLs to the images and the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed. But the important thing here is that very different kinds of nouns can be treated the same. Whether the noun is an image, text, video, an mp3, a slideshow, whatever. I can GET all of those things the same way given a URL.

4. What does a GET do?

        Our brains are somehow smart enough to know that the same verbs, like GET, can be applied to many different nouns. Some verbs are more specific than others and apply only to a small set of nouns. For instance, I can't "drive" a cup and I can't "drink" a car. But some verbs are almost universal like GET, PUT, and DELETE.

5. What does a POST do?

        Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET. If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST. If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT, or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH. The only thing left to figure out is what the data models should look like.

6. What does PUT do?

        Web pages usually have images, right? Those are separate resources. The web page just specifies the URLs to the images and the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed. But the important thing here is that very different kinds of nouns can be treated the same. Whether the noun is an image, text, video, an mp3, a slideshow, whatever. I can GET all of those things the same way given a URL.

7. What does PATCH do?

        Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET. If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST. If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT, or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH. The only thing left to figure out is what the data models should look like.
