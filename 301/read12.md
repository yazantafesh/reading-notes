# NoSQL vs SQL Article

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

|SQL                                                                         |NoSQL                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS);                            |primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.   |
|table based databases                                                        |document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or  wide-column stores
|have predefined schema                                                       |have dynamic schema for unstructured data.|
|vertically scalable                                                          |horizontally scalable|
|uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data| queries are focused on collection of documents.| Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language).|
----------------------------------------------------------

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

    For complex queries: SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment.

2. Give a real world example.

    MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

    Fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data).

4. Give a real world example.

    Hbase is an example for this purpose.

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

    NoSQL database.

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

    NoSQL database.

# NoSQL vs SQL Video

1. What does SQL stand for?

    Structure query language.

2. What is a realational database?

    That means we have a database which works with certain assumptions or in certain way and it supports the sq language the structured query language such as a database works with tables.

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?

    SQ language the structured query language such as a database works with tables.

4. What is a ‘schema’?

    a collection of logical structures of data.

5. What is a NoSQL database?

    a type of database that stores and retrieves data without needing to define its structure first.

6. How does it work?

    Relational databases rely on tables, columns, rows, or schemas to organize and retrieve data. In contrast, NoSQL databases do not rely on these structures and use more flexible data models.

7. What is inside of a Mongo database?

    Documents, Collections.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

    MongoDB; because you don't have to use a Schema.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

    In NoSQL database you will have some duplicate data and if other data in a collection changes you need to update the other collection.
