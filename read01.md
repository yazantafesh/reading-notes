The first article which is about choosing a text editor has taught me that the choice of a text editor is completely a personal choice and has no effect on the outcome whatsoever and you should always choose the one you're most comfortable using. That would probably be because of the features that text editor has, such as code completion, syntax highlighting, different themes and maybe different kinds of extensions. You can also use your default OS text editors but you must have in mind that they probably have none of the features listed above, but they can always get the job done. It also listed some third party text editors and explained the difference between a text editor and an IDE.
 

The second article is an explanation of the term terminal, which starts with a prompt then the command wanted with a space between them. And in the lines directly under this command you'll find the output of the said command, then if the process is done, you'll find the prompt appearing again at the bottom. To get a terminal on Windows you'll need an SSH client while on other OSs you can find them already there. Also there is something called a shell which controls how the terminal will behave on your pc and you can figure out your shell type with (echo) command. Arrow keys can be used as shortcuts.
 

The third article which talks about navigation is basically what we learned today in the lecture. Learned a few commands like pwd -> Print Working Directory. ls -> List. cd -> change directory. Also learned that there are two types of paths but they both lead to the same place if used correctly. And finally that there are multiple ways to move around and navigate in the system and you can always move up to a parent directory.
 

The final article says that everything is considered a file in Linux. Also Linux does not care about the file extension, it always opens the file to check what it has. Noting that Linux is case sensitive and treats lowercase and uppercase letters differently. If we want to change directory to a file with a space in its name, we have to use quotes or escape characters. Finally, there are hidden files in Linux and they can be distinguished by having a dot in the start of the name, and cannot be shown by ls command but by "ls -a".
