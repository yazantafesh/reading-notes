A function must have a name, parameters and a code inside it. When you need to use the function it must be called, and when a value is expected to be returned from that function the response is called a return value.
the creation of a function (function functionName{code}) is called declaration. Writing the function's name and paranthesis after it is calling it. Information can be given to the function either in the declaration or when it is called depending on the function itself.
