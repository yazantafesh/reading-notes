Then it explains what Git is, which is a DVC that is made up of snapshots that works on local operations and constantly tracks changes and minimizes the possibility of data loss.

Then it explains how to install Git on your PC and the initial customization steps to get it working, configure variables and identity settings then choose a default text editor and checking the settings before getting started. After that it goes to the repository setup part which can be importing or cloning.

Then we go to the Workflow part which explains the repository structure and how to handle files and how to commit and push changes to those files to a remote repository and also the stash option which helps when you don't want to apply the changes yet but don't want to lose them either.
