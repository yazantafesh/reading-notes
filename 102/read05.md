This read starts with talking about comparison operators, they are used to compare a value in the script to the value you might expect it to be and it will give you a boolean result.

(==) is equal to. which compares two values
(===) strict equal to. compares both data type and value
(!=) is not equal to. compares two values to see if they are **not** the same
(!==) strict not equal to. compares both values and data types to check if they are **not** the same
(>) greater than
(<) less than
(>=) greater than or equal to
(<=>) less than or equal to

logical operators allow the comparison of the results of more than one comparison operator.

((5<2) && (2>=3)) do both expressions evaluate to true? no? then it will give out false

&& Logical and
|| Logical or
! Logical not  !true condition returns false and vice versa

Then it starts talking about loops which are used to repeat a code as long as a condition is true and does that continuously until the outcome is false.

-FOR is used when a code is needed to run for a number of times
-WHILE is used when a code is needed to run as long as a condition is true
-DO WHILE is similar to while but it will always run the statement inside curly brackets at least once even if the condition is false.

for (var i=o; i<10; i++){document.write(i);} is an example of a for loop and variable i acts as the counter for this statement and the code keeps looping until i is not smalled than 10.
